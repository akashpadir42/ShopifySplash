# ShopifySplash
I designed a Shopify website with key features like mobile responsiveness, eye-catching animations, product listings with pricing, a testimonial section, and easy contact options. The technologies used include React.js, React Vite, React Hooks, react-router-dom, Tailwind CSS, React Icons, and Framer Motion for animations.
